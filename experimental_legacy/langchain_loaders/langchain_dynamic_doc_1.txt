Members gain in-depth experience working on satellite missions in a way otherwise inaccessible to undergraduate students.\n\nWe are passionate about developing low-cost, miniaturized systems to address problems that have yet to be solved. Many of our open-source designs can be used for other amateur satellites and student satellite design teams. We are a fully student-run, student-funded satellite design team based out of Toronto, Canada since 2014.\n\nRead more about our mission statement here:\n\n\n\nUTAT Team Goals\n\n\n\nFall 2024\n\nALT\n\nValues\n\nUTAT Space Systems has a track record of making ambitions come true. We’re fueled by a pioneering spirit that carries us above and beyond. And together we enable highly skilled students to continually push boundaries, tackle big challenges, and imagine solutions that inspire and endure.\n\nMoonshot Thinking\n\n🚀\n\nConstantly seek new opportunities for learning and improvement. Do the hard stuff. Be visionary. Encourage innovation by giving others the freedom to try and fail. Push the technological envelope. Reach for the stars.\n\nTenacity\n\n🎆\n\nWhen things explode, admire the fireworks, and then get ready to make another attempt.\n\nEmpowerment\n\n🙌\n\nGrow psychological safety and camaraderie to give everyone a voice. When humans work together, their whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Trust the team.\n\nInspiration\n\n❤️\u200d🔥\n\nFueled by our love of space, we’re driven to solve challenging problems, lead the charge, and awaken that same drive all through mentorship. We strive to bring up the best engineers of our generation, and jump-start their careers in the aerospace field and beyond.\n\nContinuous Improvement\n\n🌲\n\nThe decisions made today define where we will be tomorrow. Learn from team veterans so that one day, you may become a veteran yourself. Pass on knowledge so that the team of the future may stand on your shoulders. You run so they can fly.\n\nTeamwork\n\n🏉\n\nThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Work, learn, and grow together through leadership. Tackling difficult problems is more fun and rewarding as a multiplayer game.')]
